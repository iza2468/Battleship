# Battleship
Final summative project

# PLANS
Note - All planning is subject to changes.

Positions of units will be stored in a list of squares, much like a standard game of Battleship, formatted as such:
[[00,10,20,30,40,50 ...]
 [01,11,21,31,41,51 ...]
 [02,12,22,32,42,52 ...]
 ...]
 and so on until the dimensions of the board are reached.
 The values (currently coordinates) will contain the object occupying that square.



For our final project we want to create Battleship. We were looking for a fun two player game that is recognizable to everyone. Due to the trying times of isolation and the Covid-19 pandemic we realized the importance of those close to us. For centuries board games have brought people together and given us a sense of community and the opportunity for social gathering. Games like Battleship acted as a mutual language transcending cultural barriers. By creating this game we seek to emulate the joys of childhood and the sense of community. 

On a technical level, the game can be made as simple or as complicated as time allows. This can be done through power ups, animations, game modes, etc.
This limit of the game is only time and creativity.


Note: all details are subject to changes and balance patches.
